                        with various ideas which have been compiled in

                        and based on the viewpoints of a manager and

                            and dispatched workers. Since working time can be
                            set for not only each individual pattern but also
                            daily irregular patterns, this will make it easier
                            for you to calculate salary or a dispatch charge.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            &emsp;Most of unlisted companies are family companies.
                            The investment in your company is probably made
                            by families, relatives, friends, and executives
                            by themselves. Stock transfer (trade) among these
                            people concerned is ruled strictly by tax law.
                            You don’t want to pay it if possible.
                        </p>

                            &emsp;"How much can we make a trade at, then?"
                            This system answers the question. When issuing
                            a new stock, a "present" reasonable price
                            turns out by controlling time-series data such as
                            an accepted price, a sales price, and a purchase
                            price. This system is essential for owners.

                            &emsp;"Sales of service" including labor costs requires
                            understanding of specific cost. This automatically

                            insurance premium,and labor insurance premium,
                            in addition to a transportation cost, and then
                            figures out the cost price. By using this, a cost
                            rate is calculated with assumed working hours of
                            the upper limit and the lower limit based on
                            monthly regular-working hours, which is very
                            appreciated for its clear profitability.

                            &emsp;Nowadays, every company has its own Home Page.
                            Our HP System offers not only the contents open

                            but also the contents for employees.
                            An announcement from a company to employees
                            is made by the function of "announcement upload

                            knowledge and can be easily replaced and uploaded.
                            As for the employees, they can download the necessar
                            application form anytime with the internet at home,
                            and in fact Attendance Management System can be used

                            writing for safety confirmation is available to
                            the specific pages from all over the world.
                            You can add various functions corresponding
                            with the needs in your company, and can make
