This business is called<span style="font-family : 'century'"> System Engineering Services (SES) </span>.

This service style is called "support". The contents include

   like Resona Bank, Foreign-exchange Management System,
   Loan Exposure Management System (they are all mega-system),

   on the other a large one takes more than a year for 
   the development. Our system engineers join these projects.

   For example, a rental car system for major leasing
   companies is based on information of a rental period,
   a type of vehicles, and rental location of the office.
   It searches the car meeting customer's conditions in
   a certain area and notifies clients of the searching
   result. Then the system instructs assignment of 
   the cars, from which are left in each office, to utilize
   them most effectively. Our company is planning this system.
